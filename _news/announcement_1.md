After intensive preparation and fierce competition, I am fortunate to win the **Tsinghua Presidential Scholarship**, the highest award for Tsinghua undergraduates. Special thanks to [Prof. Yu Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j8JGVvoAAAAJ) for in-person recommendation, [Prof. Dirk Englund](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZFpENKoAAAAJ) for my research evaluation, and everyone who have helped me through the hard period!
