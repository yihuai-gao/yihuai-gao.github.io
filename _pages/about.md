<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

<!-- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

I am Yihuai Gao (高义淮), a senior undergraduate in the department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. I am fortunate to visit the [MIT Quantum Photonics Group](https://www.rle.mit.edu/qp/) and was advised by [Prof. Dirk Englund](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZFpENKoAAAAJ) in the summer of 2022. My research interest includes quantum technology, computational imaging and AI for science.

Currently, I am working with the guide of [Prof. Bowen Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h3Nsz6YAAAAJ) for bachelor's thesis in the Tsinghua EE department.
