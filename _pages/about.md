<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

<!-- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! I am Yihuai Gao (高义淮), a second-year Ph.D. student in EE Department, Stanford University. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/) in the field of robot learning. I'm broadly interested in building robot systems and training robot manipulation policies. 

Prior to Stanford, I obtained a dual bachelor's degree (B.Eng in EE and B.S. in Math) from Tsinghua University in 2023, where I worked with Prof. [Bowen Zhou](http://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/author/bowen-zhou/) and Prof. [Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/) (at Harvard). I also had a great summer working with Prof. [Dirk Englund](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZFpENKoAAAAJ&hl=en) at MIT in 2022.
